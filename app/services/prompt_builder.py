    "poor lighting, a messy or plain background, a slightly awkward angle, "
    "or an imperfect crop, and fully correct all of that. Reframe the shot "

    "extreme close-up, not too far away, subject filling a natural, "
    "well-composed portion of the frame at a flattering three-quarter or "
    "slightly elevated angle, camera level and steady, no tilted horizon. "
    "Output should look like it was shot by a professional food "
    "photographer for a restaurant menu or ad - polished, appetizing, "
    "photorealistic, 4k, no text, no watermark, no logos."
