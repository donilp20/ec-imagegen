    Image-to-image restyle only: every job reads the merchant's uploaded
    source photo from storage and sends it + a prompt to Replicate/Flux
    Kontext. The prompt itself is not stored in the DB (it's fully
    deterministic from variation_index + extra_styling), so it's rebuilt
    here and logged for debugging.

    job.error_message stores a short, human-readable summary only — full
    technical detail always goes to the logger, never to the DB.

    IMPORTANT: every failure path below must update the job's status in the
    DB. If an exception type isn't caught here, the job silently stays stuck
    at PROCESSING forever even after RQ has already abandoned it (e.g. on a
    job timeout kill). The broad `except Exception` at the bottom exists
    specifically to prevent that stuck state.
